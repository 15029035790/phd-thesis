abstract = {Mobile participatory sensing has opened the doors to numerous sensing scenarios that were unimaginable few years ago. In absence of protection mechanisms, most of these applications may however endanger the privacy of the participants and end users. In this manuscript, we highlight both sources and targets of these threats to privacy and analyze how they are addressed in recent privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the characteristics of participatory sensing. We further provide an overview of current trends and future research challenges in this area.},

abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a transformative platform that engages individuals in collecting and analyzing environmental, social and other spatio-temporal information. SC outsources spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers, i.e., individuals with mobile devices that perform the tasks by physically traveling to specified locations. However, current solutions require the workers to disclose their locations to untrusted parties. In this paper, we introduce a framework for protecting location privacy of workers participating in SC tasks. We propose a mechanism based on differential privacy and geocasting that achieves effective SC services while offering privacy guarantees to workers. We address scenarios with both static and dynamic (i.e., moving) datasets of workers. Experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed technique protects location privacy without incurring significant performance overhead. TS  - RIS},

abstract = {Location privacy is an important concern in par- ticipatory sensing applications, where users can both contribute valuable information (data reporting) as well as retrieve (location- dependent) information (query) regarding their surroundings. K-anonymity is an important measure for privacy to prevent the disclosure of personal data. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to partition user locations into groups each containing at least K users (called spatial cloaks). The mechanism is shown to preserve both locality and K-anonymity. We then devise an efficient algorithm to answer kNN queries for any point in the spatial cloaks of arbitrary polygonal shape. Extensive simulation study shows that both algorithms have superior performance with moderate computation complexity.},

We describe our security goals, threat model, and the architecture and protocols of AnonySense. We also describe how AnonySense can support extended security features that can be useful for different applications. We evaluate the security and feasibility of AnonySense through security analysis and prototype implementation.

abstract = {With the advent of mobile technology, a new class of applications, called participatory sensing (PS), is emerging, with which the ubiquity of mobile devices is exploited to collect data at scale. However, privacy and trust are the two significant barriers to the success of any PS system. First, the participants may not want to associate themselves with the collected data. Second, the validity of the contributed data is not verified, since the intention of the participants is not always clear. In this paper, we formally define the problem of privacy and trust in PS systems and examine its challenges. We propose a trustworthy privacy-aware framework for PS systems dubbed TAPAS, which enables the participation of the users without compromising their privacy while improving the trustworthiness of the collected data. Our experimental evaluations verify the applicability of our proposed approaches and demonstrate their efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London.},

Environmental and user-centric sensor data of unprecedented quantity and quality can be captured and reported by a possible user base of billions of mobile phone subscribers worldwide. The strong focus on the collection of detailed sensor data may however compromise user privacy in various regards, e.g.; by tracking a user's current location. In this survey, we identify the sensing modalities used in current participatory sensing applications, and assess the threats to user privacy when personal information is sensed and disclosed. We outline how privacy aspects are addressed in existing sensing applications, and determine the adequacy of the solutions under real-world conditions. Finally, we present countermeasures from related research fields, and discuss their applicability in participatory sensing scenarios. Based on our findings, we identify open issues and outline possible solutions to guarantee user privacy in participatory sensing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) nowadays has become a popular research topic studying how to outsource a set of spatial-temporal tasks to workers at specific locations. However, there exists a significant security concern: existing location privacy techniques are not applicable to SC. In this paper, we focus on protecting the worker location privacy against the semi-honest adversaries model while preserving the functionality of SC system. By introducing a semi-honest third party and using additive homomorphic encryption, we present a secure task assignment protocol for SC. More specifically, we propose an efficient protocol to securely compute the worker travel cost and select minimum cost worker in the encrypted domain, which reveals nothing about location privacy. We theoretically analyze that our protocol is secure as all encrypted private data are computationally indistinguishable. Extensive experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed protocol can protect worker location privacy while keeping high task assignment rate.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing systems are important sources of information for the Internet of Things (IoT) such as gathering location related sensing data for various applications by employing ordinary citizens to participate in data collection. In order to improve the Quality of Information (QoI) of the collected data, the system server needs to coordinate participants with different data collection capabilities and various incentive requirements. However, existing participant coordination methods require the participants to reveal their trajectories to the system server which causes privacy leakage. But, with the improvement of ordinary citizens' consciousness to protect their rights, the risk of privacy leakage may reduce their enthusiasm for data collection. In this paper, we propose a participant coordination framework, which allows the system server to provide optimal QoI for sensing tasks without knowing the trajectories of participants. The participants work cooperatively to coordinate their sensing tasks instead of relying on the traditional centralized server. A cooperative data aggregation, an incentive distribution method, and a punishment mechanism are further proposed to both protect participant privacy and ensure the QoI of the collected data. Simulation results show that our proposed method can efficiently select appropriate participants to achieve better QoI than other methods, and can protect each participant's privacy effectively.},

However, the large-scale deployment of mobile cloud computing is hindered by the concerns on possible privacy leakage. In this paper, we investigate the privacy issues in the ad hoc mobile cloud computing, and propose a framework that can protect the location privacy when allocating tasks to mobile devices. Our mechanism is based on differential privacy and geocast, and allows mobile devices to contribute their resources to the ad hoc mobile cloud without leaking their location information. We develop analytical models and task allocation strategies that balance privacy, utility, and system overhead in an ad hoc mobile cloud. We also conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets, and the results show that our framework can protect location privacy for mobile devices while providing effective services with low system overhead.},
