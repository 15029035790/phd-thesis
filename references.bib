abstract = {Mobile sensing exploits data contributed by mobile users (e.g., via their smart phones) to make sophisticated infer- ences about people and their surrounding and thus can be applied to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring and healthcare. However, the large-scale deployment of mobile sensing applica- tions is hindered by the lack of incentives for users to participate and the concerns on possible privacy leakage. Although incentive and privacy have been addressed separately in mobile sensing, it is still an open problem to address them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose two privacy-aware incentive schemes for mobile sensing to promote user participation. These schemes allow each mobile user to earn credits by contributing data without leaking which data it has contributed, and at the same time ensure that dishonest users cannot abuse the system to earn unlimited amount of credits. The first scheme considers scenarios where a trusted third party (TTP) is available. It relies on the TTP to protect user privacy, and thus has very low computation and storage cost at each mobile user. The second scheme removes the assumption of TTP and applies blind signature and commitment techniques to protect user privacy.},

@article{Miao2016,
abstract = {Mobile/spatial crowdsourcing is a class of crowdsourcing applications in which workers travel to specific locations in order to perform tasks. As workers may possess different levels of competence, a major research challenge for spatial crowdsourcing is to control the quality of the results obtained. Although existing mobile crowdsourcing systems are able to track a wide range of performance related data for the participating workers, there still lacks an automated mechanism to help requesters make key task allocation decisions including: 1) to whom should a task to allocated; 2) how much to pay for the result provided by each worker; and 3) when to stop looking for additional workers for a task. In this paper, we propose a budget-aware task allocation approach for spatial crowdsourcing (Budget-TASC) to help requesters make these three decisions jointly. It considers the workers' reputation and proximity to the task locations to maximize the expected quality of the results while staying within a limited budget. Furthermore, it supports payments to workers based on how their track records. Extensive experimental evaluations based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that Budget-TASC outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly in terms of reduction in the average error rate and savings on the budget.},

abstract = {In mobile crowdsourcing systems, smartphones can collectively monitor the surrounding environment and share data with the platform of the system. The platform manages the system and encourages smartphone users to contribute to the crowdsourcing system. To enable such sensing system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to motivate users to share the sensing capabilities of their smartphones. In this paper, we propose ProMoT, which is a Profit Maximizing Truthful auction mechanism for mobile crowdsourcing systems. In the proposed auction mechanism, the platform acts as an auctioneer. The smartphone users act as the sellers and submit their bids to the platform. The platform selects a subset of smartphone users and assigns the tasks to them. ProMoT aims to maximize the profit of the platform while providing satisfying rewards to the smartphone users. ProMoT consists of a winner determination algorithm, which is an approximate but close-to-optimal algorithm based on a greedy mechanism, and a payment scheme, which determines the payment to users. Both are computationally efficient with polynomial time complexity. We prove that ProMoT motivates smartphone users to rationally participate and truthfully reveals their bids. Simulation results show that ProMoT increases the profit of the platform in comparison with an existing scheme.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones have led to the emergence of mobile crowdsourcing markets, where several tens of thousands of smartphone users participate to perform tasks in the physical world. Mobile crowdsourcing plat-forms are uniquely different from their online counter-parts in that they cater to smartphone users, require spa-tial mobility, and have tasks that involve more data col-lection and less human computation. Despite the emer-gence and importance of such mobile marketplaces, lit-tle to none is known about their dynamics. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of several aspects of mobile crowdsourcing markets based on a year-long dataset from a leading mobile platform. We find that like online crowdsourcing markets, a small core group of workers account for a disproportionately large proportion of activity generated in the market. We find that these super agents are highly efficient, work-ing on tasks more quickly and picking fewer lowly priced tasks. We discover that while all agents chain several tasks into one session, hence potentially amor-tizing travel costs, super agents are 3× more likely to chain tasks. Unlike online crowdsourcing markets, we find a skew towards more males, an even younger pop-ulation, and higher education levels.},

abstract = {Online labor markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, have been used to crowdsource simple, short tasks like image labeling and transcription. However, expert knowledge is often lacking in such markets, making it impossible to complete certain classes of tasks. In this work we introduce an alternative mechanism for crowdsourcing tasks that require specialized knowledge or skill: communitysourcing — the use of physical kiosks to elicit work from specific populations. We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati: the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80{\%} of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2{\%} higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33{\%} lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams. These results indicate that communitysourcing can successfully elicit high-quality expert work from specific communities.},

However, this new data collection paradigm has not been very successful yet mainly because of the lack of incentives for participation. Although several incentive schemes have been proposed to encourage user participation, none has used location information and imposed budget and coverage constraints, which will make the scheme more realistic and efficient. We propose a recurrent reverse auction incentive mechanism with a greedy algorithm that selects a representative subset of the users according to their location given a fixed budget. Compared to existing mechanisms, our incentive scheme improves the area covered by more than 60 percent acquiring a more representative set of samples after every round while maintaining the same number of active users in the system and spending the same budget.},

In a mobile phone sensing system, the platform re-cruits smartphone users to provide sensing service. Existing mobile phone sensing applications and systems lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participa-tion. To address this issue, we design incentive mechanisms for mobile phone sensing. We consider two system models: the platform-centric model where the platform provides a reward shared by participating users, and the user-centric model where users have more control over the payment they will receive. For the platform-centric model, we design an incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game, where the platform is the leader while the users are the followers. We show how to compute the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility of the platform is maximized, and none of the users can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. For the user-centric model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, which is com-putationally efficient, individually rational, profitable, and truthful. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our incentive mechanisms.},

With the increasing ubiquity of location sensing included in mobile devices we investigate the arising opportunities for mobile crowdsourcing making use of the real world con- text. In this paper we assess how the idea of user-generated content, web-based crowdsourcing, and mobile electronic coordination can be combined to extend crowdsourcing beyond the digital domain and link it to tasks in the real world. To explore our concept we implemented a crowd- sourcing platform that integrates location as a parameter for distributing tasks to workers. In the paper we describe the concept and design of the platform and discuss the results of two user studies. Overall the findings show that integrat- ing tasks in the physical world is useful and feasible. We observed that (1) mobile workers prefer to pull tasks rather than getting them pushed, (2) requests for pictures were the most favored tasks, and (3) users tended to solve tasks mainly in close proximity to their homes. Based on this, we discuss issues that should be considered during designing mobile crowdsourcing applications.},

abstract = {User participation is one of the most important elements in participatory sensing application for providing adequate level of service quality. However, incentive mechanism and its economic model for user participation have been less addressed so far in this research domain. This paper studies the economic model of user participation incentive in participatory sensing applications. To stimulate user participation, we design and evaluate a novel reverse auction based dynamic pricing incentive mechanism where users can sell their sensing data to a service provider with users' claimed bid prices. The proposed incentive mechanism focuses on minimizing and stabilizing the incentive cost while maintaining adequate level of participants by preventing users from dropping out of participatory sensing applications. Compared with random selection based fixed pricing incentive mechanism, the proposed mechanism not only reduces the incentive cost for retaining the same number of participants but also improves the fairness of incentive distribution and social welfare. It also helps us to achieve the geographically balanced sensing measurements and, more importantly, can remove the burden of accurate price decision for user data that is the most difficult step in designing incentive mechanism. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) has grown to be a powerful computation paradigm to harness human power to solve real-world problems. Many commercial MCS platforms have arisen, enabling various novel applications. As crowd workers can be unreliable, a critical issue of these platforms is quality control. Many task assignment approaches have been proposed to increase the quality of crowd sourced tasks by matching workers and tasks in a bipartite graph. However, they fail to apply to MCS platforms where tasks are bound with locations. This paper considers the quality-aware online task assignment problem with location-based tasks. The goal is to optimize tasks' overall quality by assigning appropriate sets of tasks to workers in an online manner. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic quality measurement model and a hitchhiking model to characterize workers' behavior. Then we design a polynomial-time online assignment algorithm and prove that the proposed algorithm approximates the offline optimal solution with a competitive ratio of 10/7. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Smart Source, a crowd sourcing based mobile Question {\&} Answer (Q{\&}A) system that aims to provide mobile information seekers with timely, trustworthy and accurate answers while ensuring that information providers are not inappropriately burdened. We tackle this challenge by taking advantage of both static and dynamic context and semantics from mobile users (e.g., Geolocation, social network, expertise/interest, device sensor profiles, battery level) to identify sources of information (i.e., Workers) that are trusted by the user and accurate enough for the questions at hand. Given a question, the Smart Source broker middleware executes a scalable and efficient worker selection algorithm that uses a Lyapunov optimization framework to maximize the utility of worker selection while guaranteeing the stability of the overall system. An associated assignor selection is used to scale the selection process to a large number of users. We implement the Smart Source prototype system on an Android test bed and thoroughly evaluate the system using real world applications and data, in particular those that involve geospatial questions and answers. Evaluation results indicate that Smart Source is efficient and provides superior worker selection compared to baseline approaches. Smart Source is also highly customizable: it employs a general utility function and provides a control knob to tradeoff the optimality and responding time. We believe that Smart Source will pave a way for new mechanisms of interaction among mobile users. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

In this paper, we leverage the spatial and temporal correlation among the data sensed in different sub-areas to significantly reduce the re-quired number of sensing tasks allocated (corresponding to budget), yet ensuring the data quality. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called CCS-TA, combining the state-of-the-art compressive sensing, Bayesian inference, and active learning techniques, to dynamically select a mini-mum number of sub-areas for sensing task allocation in each sensing cycle, while deducing the missing data of un-allocated sub-areas under a probabilistic data accuracy guar-antee. Evaluations on real-life temperature and air qual-ity monitoring datasets show the effectiveness of CCS-TA. In the case of temperature monitoring, CCS-TA allocates 18.0-26.5{\%} fewer tasks than baseline approaches, allocating tasks to only 15.5{\%} of the sub-areas on average while keeping overall sensing error below 0.25 • C in 95{\%} of the cycles.},

@article{Song2014,
abstract = {By using increasingly popular smartphones, participatory sensing systems can collect comprehensive sensory data to retrieve context-aware information for different applications (or sensing tasks). However, new challenges arise when selecting the most appropriate participants when considering their different incentive requirements, associated sensing capabilities, and uncontrollable mobility, to best satisfy the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements of multiple concurrent tasks with different budget constraints. This paper proposes a multitask-oriented participant selection strategy called “DPS,” which is used to tackle the aforementioned challenges, where three key design elements are proposed. First is the QoI satisfaction metric, where the required QoI metrics of the collected data are quantified in terms of data granularity and quantity. Second is the multitask-orientated QoI optimization problem for participant selection, where task budgets are treated as the constraint, and the goal is to select a minimum subset of participants to best provide the QoI satisfaction metrics for all tasks. The optimization problem is then converted to a nonlinear knapsack problem and is solved by our proposed dynamic participant selection (DPS) strategy. Third is how to compute the expected amount of collected data by all (candidate) participants, where a probability-based movement model is proposed to facilitate such computation. Real and extensive trace-based simulations show that, given the same budget, the proposed participant selection strategy can achieve far better QoI satisfactions for all tasks than selecting participants randomly or through the reversed-auction-based approaches.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of mobile smartphone users, several commercial mobile companies have exploited crowd- sourcing as an effective approach to collect and analyze data, to improve their services. In a crowdsourcing system, “human workers” are enlisted to perform small tasks, that are difficult to be automated, in return for some monetary compensation. This paper presents our crowdsourcing system that seeks to address the challenge of determining the most efficient allocation of tasks to the human crowd. The goal of our algorithm is to efficiently determine the most appropriate set of workers to assign to each incoming task, so that the real-time demands are met and high quality results are returned. We empirically evaluate our approach and show that our system effectively meets the requested demands, has low overhead and can improve the number of tasks processed under the defined constraints over 71{\%} compared to traditional approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of stimulating smartphone users to join mobile crowdsourcing applications with smartphones. Different from existing work of mechanism design, we uniquely take into consideration the crucial dimension of location information when assigning sensing tasks to smartphones. However, the location awareness largely increases the theoretical and computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce a reverse auction framework to model the interactions between the platform and the smartphones. We rigorously prove that optimally determining the winning bids is NP hard. In this paper we design a mechanism called TRAC which consists of two main components. The first component is a near-optimal approximate algorithm for determining the winning bids with polynomial-time computation complexity, which approximates the optimal solution within a factor of 1 + ln(n), where n is the maximum number of sensing tasks that a smartphone can accommodate. The second component is a critical payment scheme which, despite the approximation of determining winning bids, guarantees that submitted bids of smartphones reflect their real costs of performing sensing tasks. Through both rigid theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves truthfulness, individual rationality and high computation efficiency.},

Calling to citizen on the ground or to experts or trained am- ateurs to help in the mapping of crisis situation is a recognized and valuable practice. However, despite the experience gained from real and dramatic situations, it remains difficult to set up and execute complex processes that require actions of both people on the ground and people on the web, and to understand how to get the best result at the mini- mal cost in term of users actions. In this paper, we describe a process that can be used to assess a global situation on a map using a combi- nation of services and user operations. We want to understand how best to distribute a limited amount of human actions between different kind of tasks in order to get the most reliable result. Since it is difficult to conduct experimentation, we have decided to use simulation to reach a result that could be applied on the ground. This simulation relies on a geolocalised corpus of tweets. It provides some hints about how to deploy an exercise on the ground that are discussed as a conclusion. In addition, we propose a binary integer programming (BIP) making best use of the available workers.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile devices and crowdsourcing platforms, the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the database community. Specifically, the spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending location-based requests to workers, based on their current positions. In this paper, we consider a spatial crowdsourcing scenario, in which each worker has a set of qualified skills, whereas each spatial task (e.g., repairing a house, decorating a room, and performing entertainment shows for a ceremony) is time-constrained, under the budget constraint, and required a set of skills. Under this scenario, we will study an important problem, namely multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing (MS-SC), which finds an optimal worker-and-task assignment strategy, such that skills between workers and tasks match with each other, and workers' benefits are maximized under the budget constraint. We prove that the MS-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Therefore, we propose three effective heuristic approaches, including greedy, g-divide-and-conquer and cost-model-based adaptive algorithms to get worker-and-task assignments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our MS-SC processing approaches on both real and synthetic data sets.},

The patterns motivates the need for appropriate assignment of dynamically arriving spatial tasks to a pool for workers on the ground. The assignment is aimed at maximizing the coverage of tasks spread over spatial locations; however, the coverage depends of willingness of workers to perform tasks assigned to them. We introduce the maximum coverage assignment problem that formulates two design issues of dynamic assignment. The quantity issue determines the number of worker required for a task and selection issue determines the set of workers. We propose an adaptive algorithm that uses location diversity based on a location-based social network to address the quantity issue and employs Thompson sampling for selecting the workers by learning their willingness. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of coverage and number of assignments using real world datasets. The results show that our proposed algorithm achieves 30{\%}-50{\%} more coverage than the baseline algorithms, while requiring less workers per task.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing market systems (CMS) are platforms that enable one to publish tasks that others are intended to ac-complished. Usually, these are systems where users, called workers, perform tasks using desktop computers. Recently, mobile CMSs have appeared with tasks that exploit the mo-bility and the location of workers. For example, if a third party system requires a picture of a given place, it may pub-lish a task asking for some worker to go there, take this picture and upload it. One problem of CMSs is that the more tasks they have, the harder it is for workers to find and choose one they are interested in. Besides, workers who accomplish tasks may have no particular experience and con-sequently provide bad results for tasks. In order to improve the matching between workers and spatio-temporal tasks in mobile CMSs, we propose a conceptual framework that con-sists of two mechanisms. One considers the requirements of a task for selecting suitable workers, while the other recom-mends tasks for a worker according to his preferences and skills. As a result, workers spend less time searching tasks, more working on it, providing results with higher quality.},

In crowdsensing, it is of great interest to find the optimal task allocation, which is challenging since sensing tasks with different requirements of quality of sensing are typically associated with specific locations and mobile users are constrained by time budgets. We show that the allocation problem is NP hard. We then focus on approximation algorithms, and devise an efficient local ratio based algorithm (LRBA). Our analysis shows that the approximation ratio of the aggregate rewards obtained by the optimal allocation to those by LRBA is 5. This reveals that LRBA is efficient, since a lower (but not tight) bound on the approximation ratio is 4. We also discuss about how to decide the fair prices of sensing tasks to provide incentives since mobile users tend to decline the tasks with low incentives. We design a pricing mechanism based on bargaining theory, in which the price of each task is determined by the performing cost and market demand (i.e., the number of mobile users who intend to perform the task). Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme.},

Unlike current industry practice that relies on workers to manually pick tasks to perform, we automatically make task recommendation based on workers' historical trajectories and desired time budgets. The challenge of predicting workers' trajectories is that it is faced with uncertainties, as a worker does not take same routes every day. In this work, we depart from deterministic modeling and study the stochastic task recommendation problem where each worker is associated with several predicted routine routes with probabilities. We formulate this problem as a stochastic integer linear program whose goal is to maximize the expected total utility achieved by all workers. We further exploit the separable structures of the formulation and apply the Lagrangian relaxation technique to scale up computation. Experiments have been performed over the instances generated using the real Singapore transportation network. The results show that we can find significantly better solutions than the deterministic formulation.},

In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment ap- proach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assign- ment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a spe- cific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20{\%}, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60{\%}, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

@article{Guo2016,
abstract = {Incentive is crucial to the success of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems. Over the different manners of incentives, providing monetary rewards has been proved quite useful. However, existing monetary-based incentive studies (e.g., the reverse auction based methods) mainly encourage user participation, whereas sensing quality is often neglected. First, the budget setting is static and may not meet the sensing contexts or user anticipation. Second, they do not measure the quality of data contributed. Third, the design of most incentive schemes is quantity- or cost-focused and not quality-oriented. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN (location-based social network)-powered model is leveraged for dynamic budgeting and proper worker selection, and a combination of multi-facet quality measurements and a multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme are used to improve sensing quality. Experiments on several user studies and the crawled dataset validate TaskMe's effectiveness.},

We demonstrate how folksonomies could be adopted for the Sensor Web and other geospatial applications dealing with large volumes of data, by exploiting the geospatial information associated with three key components of such collaborative tagging systems: tags, resources and users. We propose algorithms for: i) suggesting tags for users during the tag input stage; ii) generating tag maps which provides for serendipitous browsing; and iii) personalized searching within the folksonomy. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using an existing large dataset. An implementation of the folksonomy for the emerging Sensor Web platform is also presented.},

@inproceedings{Sadilek2013,
abstract = {Research on human computation and crowdsourcing has con- centrated on tasks that can be accomplished remotely over the Internet. We introduce a general class of problems we call crowdphysics (CP)—crowdsourcing tasks that require peo- ple to collaborate and synchronize both in time and physi- cal space. As an illustrative example, we focus on a crowd- powered delivery service—a specific CP instance where peo- ple go about their daily lives, but have the opportunity to carry packages to be delivered to specific locations or individuals. Each package is handed off from person to person based on overlaps in time and space until it is delivered. We formu- late CP tasks by reduction to a graph-planning problem, and analyze the performance using a large sample of geotagged tweets as a proxy for people's location. We show that pack- ages can be delivered with remarkable speed and coverage. These results hold for the case when we know people's future locations and also when routing without global knowledge, making only local greedy decisions. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that dynamic networks of mo- bile individuals are highly navigable. Introduction},

CrowdTasker operates on top of energy-efficient Piggyback Crowdsensing (PCS) task model, and aims to maximize the coverage quality of the sensing task while satisfying the incentive budget constraint. In order to achieve this goal, CrowdTasker first predicts the call and mobility of mobile users based on their historical records. With a flexible incentive model and the prediction results, CrowdTasker then selects a set of users in each sensing cycle for PCS task participation, so that the resulting solution achieves near-maximal coverage quality without exceeding incentive budget. We evaluated CrowdTasker extensively using a large-scale real-world dataset and the results show that CrowdTasker significantly outperformed three baseline approaches by achieving 3{\%}-60{\%} higher coverage quality.},

@article{Liu2016b,
abstract = {In a densely distributed mobile crowdsourcing system, data collected by neighboring participants often exhibit strong spatial correlations. By exploiting this property, one may employ a portion of the users as active participants and set the other users as idling ones without compromising the quality of sensing or the connectivity of the network. In this work, two participant selection questions are considered: (a) how to recruit an optimal number of users as active participants to guarantee that the overall sensing data integrity is kept above a preset threshold; and (b) how to recruit an optimal number of participants with some inaccurate data so that the fairness of selection and resource conservation can be achieved while maintaining sufficient sensing data integrity. For question (a), we propose a novel task-centric approach to explicitly exploit data correlation among participants. This subset selection problem is regarded as a constrained optimization problem and we propose an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve it. For question (b), we formulate this set partitioning problem as a constrained min-max optimization problem. A solution using an improved version of the polynomial time algorithm is proposed based on (a). We validate these algorithms using a publicly available Intel-Berkeley lab sensing dataset and satisfactory performance is achieved.},

abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a transformative platform that engages individuals in collecting and analyzing environmental, social and other spatio-temporal information. SC outsources spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers, i.e., individuals with mobile devices that perform the tasks by physically traveling to specified locations. However, current solutions require the workers to disclose their locations to untrusted parties. In this paper, we introduce a framework for protecting location privacy of workers participating in SC tasks. We propose a mechanism based on differential privacy and geocasting that achieves effective SC services while offering privacy guarantees to workers. We address scenarios with both static and dynamic (i.e., moving) datasets of workers. Experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed technique protects location privacy without incurring significant performance overhead. TS  - RIS},

@inproceedings{Vu2012,
abstract = {Location privacy is an important concern in par- ticipatory sensing applications, where users can both contribute valuable information (data reporting) as well as retrieve (location- dependent) information (query) regarding their surroundings. K-anonymity is an important measure for privacy to prevent the disclosure of personal data. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to partition user locations into groups each containing at least K users (called spatial cloaks). The mechanism is shown to preserve both locality and K-anonymity. We then devise an efficient algorithm to answer kNN queries for any point in the spatial cloaks of arbitrary polygonal shape. Extensive simulation study shows that both algorithms have superior performance with moderate computation complexity.},

abstract = {We describe AnonySense, a privacy-aware system for realizing pervasive applications based on collaborative, opportunistic sensing by personal mobile devices. AnonySense allows applications to submit sensing tasks to be distributed across participating mobile devices, later receiving verified, yet anonymized, sensor data reports back from the field, thus providing the first secure implementation of this participatory sensing model. We describe our security goals, threat model, and the architecture and protocols of AnonySense. We also describe how AnonySense can support extended security features that can be useful for different applications. We evaluate the security and feasibility of AnonySense through security analysis and prototype implementation. We show the feasibility of our approach through two plausible applications: a Wi-Fi rogue access point detector and a lost-object finder. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kazemi2013TAPAS,
abstract = {With the advent of mobile technology, a new class of applications, called participatory sensing (PS), is emerging, with which the ubiquity of mobile devices is exploited to collect data at scale. However, privacy and trust are the two significant barriers to the success of any PS system. First, the participants may not want to associate themselves with the collected data. Second, the validity of the contributed data is not verified, since the intention of the participants is not always clear. In this paper, we formally define the problem of privacy and trust in PS systems and examine its challenges. We propose a trustworthy privacy-aware framework for PS systems dubbed TAPAS, which enables the participation of the users without compromising their privacy while improving the trustworthiness of the collected data. Our experimental evaluations verify the applicability of our proposed approaches and demonstrate their efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London.},

Environmental and user-centric sensor data of unprecedented quantity and quality can be captured and reported by a possible user base of billions of mobile phone subscribers worldwide. The strong focus on the collection of detailed sensor data may however compromise user privacy in various regards, e.g.; by tracking a user's current location. In this survey, we identify the sensing modalities used in current participatory sensing applications, and assess the threats to user privacy when personal information is sensed and disclosed. We outline how privacy aspects are addressed in existing sensing applications, and determine the adequacy of the solutions under real-world conditions. Finally, we present countermeasures from related research fields, and discuss their applicability in participatory sensing scenarios. Based on our findings, we identify open issues and outline possible solutions to guarantee user privacy in participatory sensing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) nowadays has become a popular research topic studying how to outsource a set of spatial-temporal tasks to workers at specific locations. However, there exists a significant security concern: existing location privacy techniques are not applicable to SC. In this paper, we focus on protecting the worker location privacy against the semi-honest adversaries model while preserving the functionality of SC system. By introducing a semi-honest third party and using additive homomorphic encryption, we present a secure task assignment protocol for SC. More specifically, we propose an efficient protocol to securely compute the worker travel cost and select minimum cost worker in the encrypted domain, which reveals nothing about location privacy. We theoretically analyze that our protocol is secure as all encrypted private data are computationally indistinguishable. Extensive experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed protocol can protect worker location privacy while keeping high task assignment rate.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing systems are important sources of information for the Internet of Things (IoT) such as gathering location related sensing data for various applications by employing ordinary citizens to participate in data collection. In order to improve the Quality of Information (QoI) of the collected data, the system server needs to coordinate participants with different data collection capabilities and various incentive requirements. However, existing participant coordination methods require the participants to reveal their trajectories to the system server which causes privacy leakage. But, with the improvement of ordinary citizens' consciousness to protect their rights, the risk of privacy leakage may reduce their enthusiasm for data collection. In this paper, we propose a participant coordination framework, which allows the system server to provide optimal QoI for sensing tasks without knowing the trajectories of participants. The participants work cooperatively to coordinate their sensing tasks instead of relying on the traditional centralized server. A cooperative data aggregation, an incentive distribution method, and a punishment mechanism are further proposed to both protect participant privacy and ensure the QoI of the collected data. Simulation results show that our proposed method can efficiently select appropriate participants to achieve better QoI than other methods, and can protect each participant's privacy effectively.},

However, the large-scale deployment of mobile cloud computing is hindered by the concerns on possible privacy leakage. In this paper, we investigate the privacy issues in the ad hoc mobile cloud computing, and propose a framework that can protect the location privacy when allocating tasks to mobile devices. Our mechanism is based on differential privacy and geocast, and allows mobile devices to contribute their resources to the ad hoc mobile cloud without leaking their location information. We develop analytical models and task allocation strategies that balance privacy, utility, and system overhead in an ad hoc mobile cloud. We also conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets, and the results show that our framework can protect location privacy for mobile devices while providing effective services with low system overhead.},
